# Programming-Fundamentals-1

This repository contains 4 projects from my programming fundamentals 1 class

Project 1 is a text-based blackjack game.
Project 2 is a character counter which calculates the frequency of inputted characters.
Project 3 is a "pokedex" that stores and changes information about certain pokemon objects.
Project 4 is a pacman style game where I, along with two other students, programmed a rudimentary AI for the "ghosts."
